Before reaching the viewpoint at the top of the Gaper buttress, turn sharp right and after 20 metres the path forks, go left and down steeply through trees over some slippery rocks. If you go down immediately beside (on right looking out) of the Gaper Buttress viewpoint you will end up in a gully that is the access for Gaper itself. "
