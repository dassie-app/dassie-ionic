   "description": "The Creche is a crag for someone new to \"outside\" climbing, probably more so than Flying is Fun. Yet there are a few routes particularly in the descent gully and just to its west, that would keep more experienced climbers engaged. It is a great cliff for climbers to take their youngsters or inexperienced friends to start climbing. You will find the bolt spacing here is generally close, similar to Flying Is Fun or Strubens Valley. An attempt has been made to bolt appropriate to the grade, so that someone new to the grade, or with only gym experience, or who may be short and/or young, can lead climb feeling fairly comfortable here, especially on the easier routes. With this in mind it may be appropriate to mention a few guidelines to outside sport climbing.\n\n1. Take 2 or 3 spare draws as nearby bolts may sometimes be clipped to increase comfort (but watch rope drag!) \n2. On the traverse routes extending with a 60cm sling (or 2 draws) may further reduce friction as the rope changes direction too sharply.\n3. Wear on the anchors is much increased by toproping directly on them.  Better practice is to leave quickdraws on the anchors until the last person has climbed.\n4. Abseiling on the anchors/chains (as opposed to lowering off) further reduces anchor wear. This wear has led to premature replacement of anchors.\n5. An efficient (and perhaps safer) way if one plans to climb neighbouring routes, is not to thread the anchors at all. The last climber lowers off the draws on the anchors, and these are collected from the neighbouring climb – assuming the two sets of anchors are close. \n\nThe routes are sometimes fairly close to each other along the cliff. In several places a separate route is described, using a significant portion of another climb. Especially where an easier route can be easily negotiated, say with a different start.  Additional bolts have been added on existing routes, to provide more protection for shorter climbers, esp where easier starts are described. Some additional bolts have been placed BETWEEN routes, to facilitate the traverse routes. \n\nThis proliferation could lead to confusion, so the use of names marked at the start (or even in the middle!) of climbs is greater than at some other areas. Traverse routes may be colour coded, with coloured marks on the bolts. Be alert to the fact that more than 1 colour may appear on a hanger, and that the ink may fade with time. If your route goes more of less straight up, ignore colour marks.\n\nThe Creche is situated at the east end of the Tranquilitas Crag, close to the boundary fence with the neighbouring farm. The safest access for larger groups and dogs is to climb down the other (west) end of Tranquilitas Crag and walk east along the base, somewhat up and down till you find very slabby rock, perhaps 500m to the East. Alternatively walk more easily along the top of the cliff until a point 40m from the boundary fence. Turn left off the cycle track and walk 30m down to the cliff edge. \n\nHere are 2 sets of abseil chains. The western pair are obviously easier to use. There is a steep gully about 30m West of this point. This is now easier/safer to down climb with a knotted rope and Via Ferrata in place. The bottom 3m has metal rungs and Ubolts in place to facilitate downclimbing. It may be better for inexperienced climbers to negotiate this gully for the first time climbing up from the base.\n\nThe first 8 or 9 climbs described below (from L to R) all start at the same place on the left (east) of the slabby area at a large corner with a sheer wall (HUFFING WARTHOG follows the finger crack) to the left.\n",
